The Sorting Hat assigns students to houses, but are the stereotypes accurate? Let's examine what each house truly values.

## The Core Values

### 🦁 Gryffindor - Courage

**Common misconception**: Gryffindors are reckless and impulsive.

**Actually**: Gryffindor values bravery and moral courage - standing up for what's right even when it's hard.

**Examples**:
- **Neville** - Overcomes fear to stand up to friends
- **Hermione** - Uses intellect in service of justice
- **McGonagall** - Brave leadership and fairness

🔎 Note: Many Gryffindors ARE intelligent (Hermione, Dumbledore, McGonagall). The house values courage OVER intellect, not instead of it.

### 🦡 Hufflepuff - Loyalty

**Common misconception**: Hufflepuffs are the "leftovers" - ordinary and boring.

**Actually**: Hufflepuff values hard work, fairness, and unwavering loyalty. They're reliably good people.

**Why they're underrated**:
- Most resistant to Voldemort's influence
- Least likely to produce dark wizards
- Cedric Diggory showed Hufflepuff excellence
- Newt Scamander - brilliant and kind

**Hufflepuff is not**:
- ❌ For the unexceptional
- ✅ For those who value community and fairness

### 🦅 Ravenclaw - Wisdom

**Common misconception**: Ravenclaws are just book-smart.

**Actually**: Ravenclaw values learning, wisdom, and creative thinking. It's about curiosity, not just grades.

**Examples**:
- **Luna** - Creative thinking and unique perspective
- **Cho** - Seeker skill (strategic intelligence)
- **Flitwick** - Master of charms through study

**The Ravenclaw riddle door** proves it - you need wit and lateral thinking, not just knowledge.

### 🐍 Slytherin - Ambition

**Common misconception**: All Slytherins are evil.

**Actually**: Slytherin values ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. Many become leaders and achievers.

**Slytherins who weren't villains**:
- **Andromeda Tonks** - Disowned for marrying Muggle-born
- **Regulus Black** - Sacrificed himself against Voldemort
- **Horace Slughorn** - Helped Harry defeat Voldemort
- **Albus Potter** - Showed bravery in Slytherin

## House Combinations

Real people are complex - most of us would fit multiple houses:

| Primary | Secondary | Example Character |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Gryffindor | Ravenclaw | Hermione Granger |
| Slytherin | Gryffindor | Harry Potter (almost!) |
| Hufflepuff | Ravenclaw | Newt Scamander |
| Ravenclaw | Slytherin | Gilderoy Lockhart |

## The Sorting Hat's Flexibility

The Sorting Hat considers your choices, not just traits. Harry could have been Slytherin, but chose Gryffindor.

**Evidence**:
- Harry asks not to be in Slytherin
- Hermione took "ages" to sort (Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw)
- Neville almost went to Hufflepuff
- Peter Pettigrew was in Gryffindor (shows house doesn't equal morality)

## House Flaws

Every house has potential downsides:

| House | Flaw | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| Gryffindor | Recklessness, arrogance | James Potter bullying Snape |
| Slytherin | Prejudice, ruthlessness | Death Eaters, pure-blood mania |
| Ravenclaw | Detachment, elitism | Lockhart's fraud |
| Hufflepuff | Naivety, being underestimated | Rarely in spotlight |

## What Your House Says About You

The house you identify with says more about what you VALUE than what you ARE:

- Value courage? → Gryffindor
- Value loyalty and fairness? → Hufflepuff
- Value knowledge and creativity? → Ravenclaw
- Value ambition and success? → Slytherin

## Conclusion

The houses aren't boxes - they're values to aspire to. The best characters show traits from multiple houses.

As the Sorting Hat's song says: "You might belong in Gryffindor... Or perhaps in Slytherin... You might belong in Hufflepuff... Or yet wise old Ravenclaw..."

The key word? **Might**. You get to choose who you want to be.
